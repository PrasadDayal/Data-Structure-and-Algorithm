  # 2. Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

- [`PrimMST.java`:](https://github.com/ShrihariKasar/Java-Programs/blob/main/DSA/3.%20Graph/Assignment%20no%207/PrimMST.java)This Java program implements Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph.

## Overview

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the spanning tree by adding the cheapest edge that connects the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree until all vertices are included.
