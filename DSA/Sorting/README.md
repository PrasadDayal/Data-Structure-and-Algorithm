# MergeSort Algorithm Implementation in Java

This Java program implements the MergeSort algorithm to sort a list of integers entered by the user.

## Description

The MergeSort algorithm is a popular sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. It recursively divides the input array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element, and then merges these subarrays in a sorted manner. 

This implementation of MergeSort utilizes Java's ArrayList to hold the integers and performs the merge sort operation on it.
